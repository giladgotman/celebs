    <string name="instructions_section1_description">"Hourglass is a virtual version of a popular classic game which is known in many countries around the world. It is also known as:
Celebs, The Hat Game, Lunchbox, Fish Bowl, Salad Bowl, Who Is The Man &amp; The Name Game.

You'll need at least 4 people to play, but it only gets more fun with more players.

Hop on a video call and play through rounds of:
<b>Describe, One Word &amp; Charades</b>."
    </string>

    <string name="instructions_section2_description">"
One person creates a game and shares it with others

Each player writes their words on “cards” that would be guessed later

Then you will have to split into teams, players from each team will alternate turns, giving clues to their team to guess as many cards as possible against the clock (aka Hourglass)

There'll be 3 rounds, and cards will get recycled after each round!
